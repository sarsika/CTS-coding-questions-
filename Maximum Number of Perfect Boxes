1. Maximum Number of Perfect Boxes
Problem Statement
At the end of a working day, a bakery prepares N pastries, where each pastry contains a
certain number of cherries. The bakery wants to pack these pastries into boxes.
A box is said to be perfect if the sum of cherries of the pastries in that box is divisible by 3.
Any number of pastries can be placed in a box, and each pastry can be used only once.
You are given an integer N representing the number of pastries and an integer array A of
size N, where each element denotes the number of cherries on a pastry.
Your task is to determine the maximum number of perfect boxes that can be formed by
grouping the pastries in any order.

Input Format
 The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of pastries.
 The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the number of
cherries on each pastry.

Output Format
 Print a single integer representing the maximum number of perfect boxes that can
be formed.

Sample Input
7
3 1 6 4 7 5 2
Sample Output
4
Note
 Grouping of pastries can be done in any order.
 Each pastry must belong to at most one box.

        for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
            int x = sc.nextInt() % 3;
            if(x == 0) 
                count0++;
            else if(x == 1) 
                count1++;
            else
                count2++;
            
        }
        int boxes=0;
        boxes += count0;
        int pair = Math.min(count1, count2);
        boxes += pair;
        count1 -= pair;
        count2 -= pair;
        boxes += count1 / 3;
        boxes += count2 / 3;
        System.out.println(boxes);
        sc.close();
    }
